<!--
This example highlights the problem of multiple instances being suitable for auto-wiring.
The expected behaviour is both consumers are wired to the first producer,
but in terms of Principle of Least Astonishment it might be better if this threw an
exception by default (assuming the user has done this by accident), and only by
setting a flag will it actually go ahead an autowire?
